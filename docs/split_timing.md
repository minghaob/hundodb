## Split timings
When exporting LiveSplit (*.lss) from a run in HundoDB, it is possible to also include the split times in the exported file.

However, be aware that the split timing might be different from what the runner uses originally.

If the split times are to be used for comparison (either when practicing or with another run), make sure that you also split as follows:
| Type   | Split timing |
|---|---|
| Shrines   | When **screen turns black** to start the loading sequence when leaving shrine  |
| Towers  | When dialog box says **"Sheikah Tower activated."** after Link puts down the Sheikah Slate  |
| Divine Beasts  | When **screen turns white** after defeating Blight  |
| Enter Divine Beasts | When dialog box says **"Travel Gate registered to map."** after Link scans the Sheikah Slate |
| Paraglider | When the **"Paraglider"** item text box is displayed  |
| Thunder Helm | When the **"Thunder Helm"** item text box is displayed  |
| Warps | When confirming **"Travel"** on the map screen  |
| Koroks |  When the **"Korok Seed"** item text box is displayed  |
